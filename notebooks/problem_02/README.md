# Problem 2: ‚öΩ Market Value, Nationality, and Player Type ‚Äî Hypothesis Testing Using FIFA Data

## üîç Context and Research Question

In global football, young players are often perceived as more valuable investments, attacking players are praised for their technical excellence, and some nationalities ‚Äî like Brazilians or Argentinians ‚Äî are associated with exceptional on-pitch talent. But are these perceptions backed by data?

In this task, you will use player statistics from FIFA to examine whether these common assumptions hold up under statistical scrutiny. You will test three specific hypotheses related to age, nationality, and playing position using real-world data extracted from a FIFA player database.

Your goal is to formulate each hypothesis clearly, test it using appropriate statistical methods, and interpret the results. This task is designed to help you understand and practice the core steps of hypothesis testing, from preparing the data and choosing the right test to reporting conclusions.

## üß™ Task Description

You are provided with a dataset containing detailed information about football players, including their age, market value, nationality, position, overall rating, and skill attributes. The data is available here: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mukeshmanral/fifa-data-for-eda-and-stats/data)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mukeshmanral/fifa-data-for-eda-and-stats/data].

Your task is to verify the following three research claims using hypothesis testing:

1. Younger players (under 25) are more valuable on the transfer market than older players.

2. Brazilian players have a higher average skill rating (measured by dribbling and ball control) than German players.

3. Attacking players (for example: strikers and attacking midfielders) have significantly better passing skills than defenders.

To complete the task, you will need to clean and prepare the data, define the testable groups for each hypothesis, choose and justify the appropriate statistical test for each case, and draw clear conclusions based on the results. Your analysis should follow a reproducible process and present results in a way that is both visual and interpretable.

The aim is not to prove anything with certainty, but to understand how statistical testing can help validate or challenge popular assumptions in sports data.

Make sure your analysis includes visual support where helpful (such as box plots or histograms), and reflects critically on the meaning and possible limitations of your findings.
